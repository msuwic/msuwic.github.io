                            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Sophie Martin and I am a senior studying Computer Science at MSU, and this year's President! 
                                My computer science interests include frontend web development and UI/UX design. Outside of WIC, I am a ULA for CSE 231, 
                                an ambassador for Women in Engineering K-12 Outreach & Recruitment, and a mentor for Girls Who Code. I have also had the 
                                opportunity to intern for Cigna Healthcare for two years. In my free time I enjoy finding new restaurants and coffee shops to try, 
                                and I love attending MSU sports!</p>
                            <p>As President, I want to continue to provide support to women in computing fields and allow our club to be a safe space 
                                for people interested in CS! I have been a member of WIC since my freshman year, and I have made some of my closest friends 
                                through it and very much value all the time I have spent with this organization. Always feel free to reach out to me - I love talking 
                                about my experiences at MSU and answering any questions regarding WIC! Hope to see you at our meetings this year, Go Green!

                            <p>Hello! I am Samantha Sebestyen and I am serving as the WIC Vice President this year. I am a junior at MSU as a Computer Science major with a Media & Information cognate as well as a minor in Media Photography. 
                                I am currently interested in UI/UX and web development. This is my third year involved in WIC, but I also take part in the Women in Engineering program here at MSU. It is so inspiring to see people come together to lift up women in the STEM field, and I love the community that WIC fosters.
                                In my free time, I love to attend MSU basketball and hockey games, read, and bake lots of dessert. This year I’ll be working as an undergraduate learning assistant for CSE 102 as well as working at the athletics broadcasting studio Spartan Vision as a student producer. 
                                I hope to use my skills to improve our communication with prospective and current members, support our leadership, and look forward to meeting any and all who come to the WIC meetings!

                            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Tatiana and I am the Outreach Chair for WIC. I am passionate 
                                about working with my community, so I am very excited to have this position! As Outreach
                                 Chair, I hope to encourage more women and members of other underrepresented groups to
                                  pursue a career in computer science. I am also involved in the Spartan Girls Who Code
                                   program as a mentor and hope to do more outreach in the future. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Here is a little more about me: I am currently a second-year pursuing a double major in 
                                Computer Science and Information Science with a Spanish minor. My technical interest 
                                lies in software development and I hope to become a full-stack developer in order to 
                                combine technical skills with creativity. This semester you will find me studying, exploring 
                                campus, and reading! Please reach out to me if you have any questions!
                            </p>
