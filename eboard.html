                                Hi everyone!!!! My name is Tatiana Voegerl and I’m the current Webmaster! I’m a junior at MSU double majoring 
                                in Computer Science and Information Science. I chose to major in CSE because I enjoy solving puzzles and 
                                love the feeling of figuring problems out. I look forward to meeting and collaborating with everyone this 
                                upcoming school year! 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of WIC, I’m a lead mentor for Girls Who Code and Technovation and also do research in the BEACON 
                                center here at MSU. I’ve also have had the privilege to intern at Leidos as a software engineer.
                                In addition to being a member of WIC, I am also a member of Phi Sigma Rho engineering sorority.

                                Hello everyone, my name is Grace and I will be treasurer for WIC 2023-2024 school year. 
                                I’m a senior studying Computer Science. I am involved in MSU various ways, especially in 
                                College of Engineering, by being an undergraduate learning assistant for PHY184 EMP-Cubed, 
                                a Women in Engineering ambassador, Girls Who Code/Technovation mentor, and a professorial 
                                assistant with a CSE professor through the honors college. In the summer of 2023, I have 
                                interned with Bank of America as their Global Technology Summer Analyst in Jersey City. 
                                My very first involvement at WIC was through WIC’s study buddy program that connected 
                                students in the organization by their major so they can get to know one another and study 
                                together. I found this to be very helpful and since then, I started getting more involved 
                                in WIC. WIC will be offering many valuable opportunities (not just career perspective but 
                                also good friendships) that I don’t want you all to miss out! If you have any questions or 
                                just want to chat, feel free to reach out! Hope to see you all in our meetings :)

                                Secretary this year. I am from India but currently live in Dubai. Apart from CS, 
                                I am also taking minors in Data Science and CMSE. I have always been passionate about 
                                machine learning, and currently, I’m working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant on 
                                a computer vision project at HAAIL. You can also find me working in the CSE 231 
                                department, where I’m a ULA. If you ever want to chat, have questions, or just want 
                                to hang out, feel free to reach out anytime! :)

                                curretly a shophmore studying computer science. What I love about WIC is that it allowed me to find 
                                a community where there were other woman just like me. I found a place where I was comfortable asking 
                                questions that stemmed from homework to regular life struggles. Outside of WIC, I'm a part of the 
                                Phi Sigma Rho sorority. I love meeting new people, and am looking forward to this year :)

                                I first joined WIC my sophomore year, and it has been the highlight of my Tuesdays ever since. 
                                I first served as the Outreach Chair, and this year, I am serving as the Lean-In Chair. The leadership 
                                and networking skills I have learned through WIC and my WIC sponsorship to the Grace Hopper conference 
                                have empowered me academically and professionally. The strong female leadership I see within this 
                                organization is so exciting. I could not be more proud that my fellow WICsters and executive board members 
                                represent the next generation of leadership in tech.

                                as how impactful it can be. Technology is used in every industry, so I can explore the different 
                                uses and applications. I'm really excited to help share our organization with others and grow our 
                                WIC community! WIC is an amazing community that fosters both professional and personal growth and I 
                                can't wait to meet all the new members. Outside of WIC, I have been involved in Women In Engineering 
                                and a Spartan Girls Who Code Mentor. In my free time I like to play tennis, go for nature walks, and 
                                attend MSU games!
