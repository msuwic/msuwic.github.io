                            <p>Hello! I am Samantha Sebestyen and I am serving as the WIC President this year. 
                                I am a senior at MSU as a Computer Science major with a Media & Information cognate as 
                                well as a minor in Media Photography. I am currently interested in front end development. 
                                This is my fourth year involved in WIC, but I also take part in the Women in Engineering 
                                program here at MSU. It is so inspiring to see people come together to lift up women in the 
                                STEM field, and I love the community that WIC fosters. In my free time, I love to attend MSU 
                                basketball games, read, and bake lots of dessert. This year Iâ€™ll be working as an undergraduate
                                learning assistant for CSE 102 as well as working in the athletics broadcasting program Spartan 
                                Vision as a student producer. I hope to use my skills to improve our communication with 
                                prospective and current members, support our leadership, and look forward to meeting any

                                Hi everyone! My name is Sonia Moozhayil and Iâ€™m a senior studying in both Computer Science and Psychology with 
                                a minor in Social Science Quantitive Data Analytics (SSQDA). Iâ€™m very excited to be part of E-Board this year 
                                and help out in WICâ€™s sponsorships and funding, financial records, and connections with tech companies! Some 
                                areas of CS which I personally like are Databases, Computer Graphics, Front-End and Back-End Development, and 
                                UI/UX Design. Outside of WIC, Iâ€™m also part of Phi Sigma Rho Sorority and WIE K-12 Engineering Mentor Program. 
                                Iâ€™m also an ULA for CSE 102 and a Research Assistant for the College of Social Sciences. For hobbies, I love to 
                                run, listen to music, and watch new movies and tv shows. Iâ€™m personally excited for this year as it will be my 
                                last year here in MSU, so I canâ€™t wait to make unforgettable memories this year! Also feel free to reach out 
                                anytime if any questions or just want to chat! :)

                                Outside of WIC I am an ambassador for Women In Engineering K-12 Outreach, and a mentor for Girls Who Code and 
                                Technovation. I am also an honors student leader, and a professorial assistant for the TAP Lab, 
                                and I am apart of Chaos Dance Crew. In my free time I love to dance, watch musicals, and eat cheese!

                                St. Louis, MO. I am majoring in Computational Data Science and minoring in Spanish, and I aspire to become a bioinformaticist 
                                after I graduate. I have worked at the Aguirre Lab since my freshman year as a research assistant, and that has inspired my love

                                Hi I'm Hannah and I'm a CSE major w/ a French minor. My interest in computer science started 
                                off with cyber security but has shifted to software / web development as well. This is my second 
                                year on the e-board. As this year's Lean In Chair, I hope to connect our members and create conversations. 
                                After some isolating pandemic years, it's more important than ever. I look forward to working 
                                with everyone to create an environment where everyone feels heard and supported !

                                Hey! I am Harika, a junior majoring in computer science with a minor in entrepreneurship and innovations. 
                                I enjoy Computer Science because it gives you the freedom to be creative with your solution. 
                                Also, the adrenaline rush when you find the solution is awesome! I work as a Unix admin for a bio lab her 
                                on campus and as a ULA for CSE 231 and MTH 124. I am part of Spartan Sur which is an Acapella team here on 
                                campus. I have been the Social Chair for WIC since last year. I am super excited to plan some fun events 
                                this year and cannot wait to meet new WIC members.

                                Science, and this is my second year in WIC! I chose to major in CS because I loved how broad technology is, 
                                as well as how impactful it can be. Technology is used in every industry, so I can explore the different uses 
                                and applications. I'm really excited to create new graphics and content for WIC's social media, and redefine 
                                what our brand is as the Social Media Chair. Outside of WIC, I have been involved in Women In Engineering and 
                                a Spartan Girls Who Code Mentor. In my free time I like to play tennis, go for nature walks, and draw mandalas!
